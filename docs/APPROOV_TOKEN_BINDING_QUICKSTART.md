# Approov Token Binding Quickstart

This quickstart is for developers familiar with Swift who are looking for a quick intro into how they can add [Approov](https://approov.io) into an existing project. Therefore this will guide you through the necessary steps for adding Approov with token binding to an existing Swift API server.

## How it works?

For more background, see the overview in the [README](/README.md#how-it-works) at the root of this repository.

The main functionality for the Approov token binding check is in the file [ApproovTokenMiddleware.swift](/src/approov-protected-server/token-binding-check/hello/Sources/App/Middlewares/ApproovTokenMiddleware.swift). Take a look at the `verifyApproovToken()` and `verifyApproovTokenBinding` functions to see the simple code for the checks.

## Requirements

To complete this quickstart you will need both the Swift with Vapor toolbox and the Approov CLI tool installed.

* Swift:
    + [Linux](https://docs.vapor.codes/4.0/install/linux/)
    + [macOS](https://docs.vapor.codes/4.0/install/macos/)
* Approov CLI - Follow our [installation instructions](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-installation/#approov-tool) and read more about each command and its options in the [documentation reference](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-cli-tool-reference/)

## Approov Setup

To use Approov with the Swift API server we need a small amount of configuration. First, Approov needs to know the API domain that will be protected. Second, the Swift API server needs the Approov Base64 encoded secret that will be used to verify the tokens generated by the Approov cloud service.

### Configure API Domain

Approov needs to know the domain name of the API for which it will issue tokens.

Add it with:

```text
approov api -add your.api.domain.com
```

Adding the API domain also configures the [dynamic certificate pinning](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-usage-documentation/#approov-dynamic-pinning) setup, out of the box.

> **NOTE:** By default the pin is extracted from the public key of the leaf certificate served by the domain, as visible to the box executing the Approov CLI command and the Approov servers.

### Approov Secret

Approov tokens are signed with a symmetric secret. To verify tokens, we need to grab the secret using the [Approov secret command](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-cli-tool-reference/#secret-command) and plug it into the Swift API server environment to check the signatures of the [Approov Tokens](https://www.approov.io/docs/latest/approov-usage-documentation/#approov-tokens) that it processes.

Retrieve the Approov secret with:

```text
approov secret -get base64
```

> **NOTE:** The `approov secret` command requires an [administration role](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-usage-documentation/#account-access-roles) to execute successfully.

#### Set the Approov Secret

Open the `.env` file and add the Approov secret to the var:

```text
APPROOV_BASE64_SECRET=approov_base64_secret_here
```

## Approov Token Check

To check the Approov token we will use the [vapor/jwt](https://github.com/vapor/jwt) and [vapor/jwt-kit](https://github.com/vapor/jwt-kit) packages. The former is used to register the Approov middleware in the Vapor application while the later is used to perform the actual check.

Add the [ApproovTokenMiddleware.swift](src/approov-protected-server/token-binding-check/hello/Sources/App/Middlewares/ApproovTokenMiddleware.swift) to your Vapor project:

```swift
import Vapor

// Using JWTKit because the JWT package assumes the token has the prefix `Bearer`.
import JWTKit

struct ApproovJWTPayload: JWTPayload {
    // Maps the longer Swift property names to the shortened keys used in the
    // JWT payload.
    enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case expiration = "exp"
        case token_binding = "pay"
    }

    var expiration: ExpirationClaim

    var token_binding: String?

    // Run any additional verification logic beyond signature verification here.
    // Since we have an ExpirationClaim, we will call its verify method.
    func verify(using signer: JWTSigner) throws {
        try self.expiration.verifyNotExpired()
    }
}

final class ApproovTokenMiddleware: Middleware {
    public func respond(to request: Request, chainingTo next: Responder) -> EventLoopFuture<Response> {
        let approov_token_claims = verifyApproovToken(in: request)

        if approov_token_claims == nil {
            // You may want to add some logging here
            return request.eventLoop.makeFailedFuture(Abort(.unauthorized))
        }

        if !verifyApproovTokenBinding(in: request, claims: approov_token_claims) {
            // You may want to add some logging here
            return request.eventLoop.makeFailedFuture(Abort(.unauthorized))
        }

        return next.respond(to: request)
    }

    private func verifyApproovToken(in request: Request) -> ApproovJWTPayload? {
        if request.headers["Approov-Token"].isEmpty {
            // You may want to add some logging here
            return nil
        }

        let approov_token = request.headers["Approov-Token"][0]

        // Returns `nil` when the token signature is invalid or has expired.
        return try? request.application.jwt.signers.verify(approov_token, as: ApproovJWTPayload.self)
    }

    private func verifyApproovTokenBinding(in request: Request, claims approov_token_claims: ApproovJWTPayload?) -> Bool {
        // Note that the `pay` claim will, under normal circumstances, be present,
        // but if the Approov failover system is enabled, then no claim will be
        // present, and in this case you want to return true, otherwise you will
        // not be able to benefit from the redundancy afforded by the failover
        // system.
        if approov_token_claims!.token_binding == nil {
            // You may want to add some logging here
            return true
        }

        if request.headers["Authorization"].isEmpty {
            // You may want to add some logging here
            return false
        }

        let token_binding_header: String = request.headers["Authorization"][0]
        let hash_digest: SHA256Digest = SHA256.hash(data: Data(token_binding_header.utf8))
        let token_binding_header_encoded: String = Data(hash_digest).base64EncodedString()

        if approov_token_claims!.token_binding != token_binding_header_encoded {
            // You may want to add some logging here
            return false
        }

        return true
    }
}
```

Register it in the Vapor application configuration, in the file [configure.swift](src/approov-protected-server/token-binding-check/hello/Sources/App/configure.swift):

```swift
import Vapor
import JWT

// configures your application
public func configure(_ app: Application) throws {
    // register the Approov middleware for all routes.
    try registerApproovMiddleware(app)

    // register routes
    try routes(app)
}

private func registerApproovMiddleware(_ app: Application) throws {
    let secret: String = Environment.get("APPROOV_BASE64_SECRET") ?? ""
    let approov_base64_secret: String = secret.trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines)

    if approov_base64_secret == "" {
        throw Abort(.internalServerError, reason: "Missing value for the environment variable APPROOV_BASE64_SECRET")
    }

    let approov_secret: Data? = Data(base64Encoded: approov_base64_secret)

    if approov_secret == nil {
        throw Abort(.internalServerError, reason: "The value in APPROOV_BASE64_SECRET env var is not a valid base64 encoded string.")
    }

    app.jwt.signers.use(.hs256(key: approov_secret!))
    app.middleware.use(ApproovTokenMiddleware())
}
```

> **NOTE:** When the Approov token validation fails we return a `401` with an empty body, because we don't want to give clues to an attacker about the reason the request failed, and you can go even further by returning a `400`.

A full working example for a simple Hello World Swift Vapor API server can be found at [src/approov-protected-server/token-binding-check/hello](/src/approov-protected-server/token-binding-check/hello).

## Test your Approov Integration

The following examples below use cURL, but you can also use the [Postman Collection](/README.md#testing-with-postman) to make the API requests. Just remember that you need to adjust the urls and tokens defined in the collection to match your deployment. Alternatively, the [README](/README.md#the-dummy-secret) at the root of this repo also contains instructions for using the preset _dummy_ secret to test your Approov integration.

#### With Valid Approov Tokens

Generate a valid token example from the Approov Cloud service:

```
approov token -setDataHashInToken 'Bearer authorizationtoken' -genExample your.api.domain.com
```

Then make the request with the generated token:

```text
curl -i --request GET 'https://your.api.domain.com/v1/shapes' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer authorizationtoken' \
  --header 'Approov-Token: APPROOV_TOKEN_EXAMPLE_HERE'
```

The request should be accepted. For example:

```text
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

...

{"message": "Hello, World!"}
```

#### With Invalid Approov Tokens

##### No Authorization Token

Let's just remove the Authorization header from the request:

```text
curl -i --request GET 'https://your.api.domain.com/v1/shapes' \
  --header 'Approov-Token: APPROOV_TOKEN_EXAMPLE_HERE'
```

The above request should fail with an Unauthorized error. For example:

```text
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized

...

{}
```

##### Same Approov Token with a Different Authorization Token

Make the request with the same generated token, but with another random authorization token:

```
curl -i --request GET 'https://your.api.domain.com/v1/shapes' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer anotherauthorizationtoken' \
  --header 'Approov-Token: APPROOV_TOKEN_EXAMPLE_HERE'
```

The above request should also fail with an Unauthorized error. For example:

```text
HTTP/1.1 401

...

{}
```
